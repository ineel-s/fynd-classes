- If we have to NOT show a lot of elements on page load. If we used v-if, it will not create the elements. So it will result in fast page load
    - Eg. 1000s of panel are hidden on page load and user clicks on one to reveal its body
- If we have to show every panel open on load - anyway Vue needs to create all the panel-body nodes.
