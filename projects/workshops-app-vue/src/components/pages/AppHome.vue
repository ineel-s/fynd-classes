                    The Workshops application serves details of (fictitious) technical workshops happening in various cities. Every workshop has a broad topic (eg. JavaScript), and a workshop has many sessions (each session covers a sub-topic, eg. Closures in JavaScript).
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can view a list of workshops, details of every workshop, sessions in a workshop, and also add a new session for a workshop.
